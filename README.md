Laboratory 2 for ID2223 HT23 Scalable Machine Learning and Deep Learning (50935) : Made by Merlijn Sevenhuijsen and Alessandro Meroli

After researching online about improvement techinques for Recurrent Neural Networks and different Data/model centric approaches we focused on two main proposal:
- tune a smaller set of hyperparameters, especially the learning rate
- at the beginnin we trained the model on a very small data set and in time we increased it.
